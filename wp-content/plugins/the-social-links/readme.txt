== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the bookmarks to my theme manually (also for themes that do not support widgets)? =

We are working on adding a template tag that will allow you to add it anywhere in your theme. Also depending on requests, we might add a shortcode allowing you to add it anywhere in a page/post.

= Are you going to add other social networks =

Yes we are. Depending on the popularity of that social network. We are trying to keep the plugin as small as possible.

= Can I use other icons? =

You can by updating the relative icons in the 'the-social-network/icons' folder. We are implementing a way for you to upload custom icons from the backend.

= Can I change the order of the icons? =

There is no way to change the order at of the icons. It is schedules for version 1.0.

= My icons are not aligning properly, what is wrong? =

The style of your website depends on your theme. If there is an issue with the alignment it must be modified by CSS in your theme.
