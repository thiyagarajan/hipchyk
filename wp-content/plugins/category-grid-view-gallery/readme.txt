== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. I cannot see the thumbnail images. Why is it so?**  
A. It may be because the cache folder used to store the generated thumbnails is not writable on your system.The Plugin uses the systems temporary directory for cache.
Also, if your post contains an image that is NOT hosted on the same server, then the thumbnail will not be generated. This is for security reasons. If your post contains an image from an external source, you can first download the image, and then host it on your server and replace it in the post.
You can also attach it as a featured image keeping your post unchanged and then choose "featured image" as the image source from Settings panel.
