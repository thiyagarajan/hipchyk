A smooth ajax-based thumbs up/down functionality for wordpress posts/pages

== Description ==

WTI Like Post is a plugin for adding like (thumbs up) and unlike (thumbs down) functionality for wordpress posts/pages. On admin end alongwith handful of configuration settings, it will show a list of most liked posts/pages. If you have already liked a post/page and now you dislike it, then the old voting will be cancelled and vice-versa.

It also has the option to reset the settings to default if needed. You can reset the like counts for all/selected posts/pages. It comes with two widgets, one to display the most liked posts/pages for a given time range and another to show recently liked posts.
